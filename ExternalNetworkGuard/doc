1. Purpose:

The guard is designed to block requests coming from outside the internal network.

2. How It Works:

When a request is made, the guard checks if it includes a specific header (X-Envoy-External-Address).
This header indicates that the request is coming from an external network.

3. Decision Making:

If the header is present, the guard stops the request and returns a 403 Forbidden status.
If the header is not present, the request is allowed to continue as normal.
